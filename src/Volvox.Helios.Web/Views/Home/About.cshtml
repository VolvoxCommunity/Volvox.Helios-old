            Volvox.Helios - Modular Discord bot written in ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, Razor. The goal of this bot is to be the only bot you'll have to add to your Discord server. It will be managed from a web interface that will show a vast array of data and statistics. Each module has its own settings and can be enabled or disabled as the admin of the Discord server chooses.
